# Obstacle Dodge

**Obstacle Dodge** is a simple Unity game project where players must dodge obstacles and trigger projectiles. This project demonstrates basic Unity scripting, collision detection, and object activation.

## Features

- Player-controlled character
- Trigger zones that activate multiple projectiles
- Basic use of Unityâ€™s physics and collision system

## About

This is my first ever Unity project. The main goal was to learn the basics of Unity game development, including scripting with C#, working with GameObjects, and handling collisions and triggers.
